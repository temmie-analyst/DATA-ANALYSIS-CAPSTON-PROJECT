# DATA-ANALYSIS-CLASS-DOCUMENTATION

##PROJECT TITLE

LITA Capstone Project

###PROJECT OVERVIEW

Utilizing Excel, SQL, and Power BI, this data analysis project integrates sales and customer data to uncover key insights, including sales trends, top-performing products, customer segments, and lifetime value, enabling informed business decisions through interactive visualizations and actionable recommendations. This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer data to extract meaningful insights that support strategic business decision-making. By examining key metrics, such as customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and regional sales performance, the analysis aims to understand factors driving revenue growth and customer satisfaction.

Utilizing tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI, this project involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to present a comprehensive view of the business landscape. The findings provide actionable insights, including identifying high-value customer segments, pinpointing successful sales strategies, and uncovering opportunities for targeted marketing efforts. Ultimately, this project demonstrates a data-driven approach to optimizing business operations and enhancing customer engagement.

###DATA SOURCES

This project utilized two distinct datasets: Sales Data and Customer Data.

-Sales Data: This dataset provides detailed records of individual sales transactions, including fields such as transaction date, product information, sales amount, quantity sold, and regional data. By analyzing this dataset, we can identify trends in product performance, regional sales variations, and overall sales growth over time.

-Customer Data: This dataset contains information about customers, though it does not include demographic attributes like age or gender. Instead, it provides basic customer identifiers, purchase frequencies, and transactional history, enabling an analysis of customer purchasing patterns and frequency.

####DATA PREPARATION

To ensure the quality and consistency of the analysis, the Sales Data and Customer Data underwent a thorough data preparation process, with each dataset processed individually due to their lack of direct relationship.

1. Data Cleaning: Both datasets contained inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicates, and varied formats in date and currency fields. Using Excel and SQL, we addressed these issues by:

-Removing duplicate entries to prevent skewed results.
-Standardizing date formats to ensure accurate chronological analysis.
-Handling missing values through deletion or imputation, depending on the significance of the data field.

2. Data Transformation:

-In Sales Data, columns were restructured for clarity, and additional calculated fields were created. For instance, a “Total Revenue” field was generated by multiplying quantity sold by sales price, while "Year" and "Quarter" fields were derived from transaction dates to enable time-based analysis.
-In Customer Data, which comprises customer ID, customer name, region, subscription type, subscription start, subscription end, and revenue, we performed several transformations:
-Calculated the subscription duration by determining the difference between the subscription start and end dates.
-Analyzed revenue contributions from each subscription type to identify high-value segments.
-Grouped customers by region to facilitate geographic analysis of subscription performance.
3. Data Validation: After cleaning and transforming the data, a final validation step was performed to ensure data consistency and accuracy. This involved cross-checking row counts, validating ranges of calculated metrics, and ensuring uniformity in data formatting.

The prepared datasets provided a reliable foundation for analysis, enabling meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior within the subscription model.

###ANALYSIS APPROACH

The analysis approach for this project involved a systematic examination of both the Sales Data and Customer Data using Excel, SQL and Power BI to derive insights and drive decision-making.

1. Excel Analysis:

After extracting relevant data subsets, Excel was utilized for deeper exploratory data analysis. Key activities included:

Pivot Tables: Constructing pivot tables to summarize sales performance by different dimensions (e.g., product type, region, and subscription type), which facilitated quick comparisons and insights.

Charts and Graphs: Visualizing trends in sales data and customer subscriptions over time using line charts and bar graphs, which illustrated seasonality and performance spikes.

What-If Analysis: Utilizing Excel’s scenario analysis tools to model potential revenue changes based on different subscription pricing strategies.


2. SQL Analysis:

SQL was used to extract and manipulate data from the Sales Data and Customer Data. Key queries were written to perform aggregations and calculations, such as:

Total Sales by Region: Using GROUP BY clauses to summarize sales figures by geographical regions, helping identify which areas contributed most to revenue.

Subscription Revenue Analysis: Analyzing customer revenue by subscription type and calculating average revenue per subscription to determine which offerings were most lucrative.

3. Power BI Visualization:

The final stage of analysis involved creating interactive dashboards in Power BI, which enhanced the presentation of insights through advanced visualization techniques. This included:

Dynamic Dashboards: Developing comprehensive dashboards that presented key metrics such as total revenue, average subscription length, and customer distribution across regions, allowing stakeholders to gain a quick overview of business performance.

Interactive Reports: Creating interactive reports where users could drill down into specific metrics, filter data by subscription type or region, and explore trends in customer behavior over time. This interactivity enabled a more nuanced understanding of the data.

Visualizations: Utilizing a variety of visualization tools such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent data clearly and effectively. For instance, a bar chart showing total revenue by region visually highlighted top-performing areas, while a line graph illustrated trends in subscription growth over time.

By integrating these methods, the analysis yielded actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance, supporting strategic recommendations for future growth.
