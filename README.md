## PROJECT TITLE

LITA Capstone Project

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Utilizing Excel, SQL, and Power BI, this data analysis project integrates sales data to uncover key insights, including sales trends, top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trend, enabling informed business decisions through interactive visualizations and actionable recommendations. This project focuses on analyzing sales data to extract meaningful insights that support strategic business decision-making. By examining key metrics, the analysis aims to understand factors driving revenue growth and sales performance. This project involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to present a comprehensive view of the business landscape.

### DATA SOURCES

This project utilized data set provided by THE INCUBATOR HUB, a tech educational institute.

The primary data source for this project is the "Sales Data" dataset providing detailed records of sales performance of a retail store which includes transaction-level data containing various attributes, including:

- Orderid
- Customer Name
- Orderdate
- Quantity
- Unitprice

### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data exploration, data cleaning, and basic summary statistics. Excel's pivot tables, and formulas were leveraged for quick insights.

- SQL: Utilized for querying the sales database to extract relevant data, perform aggregations, and filter datasets. SQL was instrumental in retrieving sales data by specific timeframes, regions, or products for more granular analysis.

- Power BI: The primary tool for data visualization. Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and generate visual reports that made it easy to communicate findings to stakeholders.



#### DATA PREPARATION

To ensure the quality and consistency of the analysis, the Sales Data underwent a thorough data preparation process:

1. Data Cleaning:The datasets contained inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicates, and varied formats in date and currency fields. Using Excel and SQL, we addressed these issues by:

- Removing duplicate entries to prevent skewed results.
  
- Standardizing date formats to ensure accurate chronological analysis.
  
- Handling missing values through deletion or imputation, depending on the significance of the data field.
  

2. Data Transformation:

- In Sales Data, columns were restructured for clarity, and additional calculated fields were created. For instance, a “Total Revenue” field was generated by multiplying quantity sold by sales price.

3. Data Validation:
- After cleaning and transforming the data, a final validation step was performed to ensure data consistency and accuracy. This involved cross-checking row counts, validating ranges of calculated metrics, and ensuring uniformity in data formatting.

The prepared datasets provided a reliable foundation for analysis, enabling meaningful insights into sales trends.

### DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH

The analysis approach for this project involved a systematic examination of both the Sales Data and Customer Data using Excel, SQL and Power BI to derive insights and drive decision-making.

1. Microsoft Excel Analysis:

- After extracting relevant data subsets, Excel was utilized for deeper exploratory data analysis. Key activities included:

- Pivot Tables: Constructing pivot tables to summarize sales performance by different dimensions such as total sales by product, region, and month.

METHODOLOGY:
````
- Excel formulas were utilized to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region for sales data while calculations on the average subscription duration and identifying the most popular subscription types for the customer data. 

- To analyze sales performance by region and product, I leveraged Excel functions to efficiently calculate key metrics such as total revenue by region and average sales per product for the sales data:

i. Total Revenue by Region: SUMIF function was used. This allows a quick calculated total revenue generated in each region by summing up sales values based on region-specific criteria.
Formula Example: =SUMIF(RegionRange, "RegionName", RevenueRange) where RegionRange refers to the list of regions and RevenueRange to the sales revenue values.

![salesdata table 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f28935b6-e4cc-4450-b111-dc10c4f59127)

- Insight Gained: This approach provided a clear view of which regions contributed the most to overall sales, helping to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.
Average Sales per Product:

ii. To measure the average sales value for each product, AVERAGEIF function was used. This helped in calculating the average sales by product, giving a better understanding of product-level performance.
Formula Example: =AVERAGEIF(ProductRange, "ProductName", RevenueRange).  where ProductRange consists of product names and RevenueRange includes Revenue.

- Insight Gained: Using AVERAGEIF allows identification of products with high average sales values, highlighting potential bestsellers and helping in making data-driven decisions for inventory and pricing strategies.

In customer data, to determine the most popular subscription type, COUNTIF function in Excel was employed, which efficiently counted the occurrence of each subscription type across the dataset. This approach helped in identifying the subscription option that was most frequently selected by customers.

- Calculating Popular Subscription Type:
Using the COUNTIF function, calculation of the frequency of each subscription type within the dataset was done. This allows the determination of which subscription option had the highest count, indicating its popularity among customers.
Formula Example: =COUNTIF(SubscriptionRange, "SubscriptionType"), where SubscriptionRange includes all subscription types.

- Insight Gained: The results provided a clear view of customer preferences for subscription types. Identifying the most popular subscription option offered valuable insights into customer engagement, helping to shape strategies for marketing and customer retention.



2. SQL Analysis:

SQL was used to extract and manipulate data from the Sales Data. Key queries were written to perform aggregations and calculations, such as:

- Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount:

````````SQL
select top 5 Customer_Id as Top_Customers , SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) as Total_Purchase from [dbo].[SalesData]
group by Customer_Id
``````


![TOP 5 CUSTOMERS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e165b7f6-77bd-4e01-87f4-b7089705af40)

- Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region:
  
```````SQL
select region, CAST((SUM(quantity)*100/(select SUM(quantity) from [dbo].[SalesData])) as varchar (10)) +'%'
AS Total_sales_Percentage from [dbo].[SalesData]
group by Region
order by Total_sales_Percentage desc
``````

CUSTOMER DATA
SQL was used to extract and manipulate data from the Customer Data. Key queries were written to perform aggregations and calculations, such as:

Calculate total revenue by subscription type

``````SQL
select SUM(revenue) as Sub_Type_Revenue from [dbo].[CustomerData] 
where SubscriptionType = 'basic'

select SUM(revenue) as Sub_Type_Revenue from [dbo].[CustomerData] 
where SubscriptionType = 'premium'

select SUM(revenue) as Sub_Type_Revenue from [dbo].[CustomerData] 
where SubscriptionType = 'standard'
``````

3. Power BI Visualization:

The final stage of analysis involved creating interactive dashboards in Power BI, which enhanced the presentation of insights through advanced visualization techniques. This included:

Dynamic Dashboards: Developing comprehensive dashboards that presented key metrics such as total revenue, average subscription length, and customer distribution across regions, allowing stakeholders to gain a quick overview of business performance.

Interactive Reports: Creating interactive reports where users could drill down into specific metrics, filter data by subscription type or region, and explore trends in sales overview, top-performing products, regional breakdowns key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends and This interactivity enabled a more nuanced understanding of the data.
 
Visualizations: Utilizing a variety of visualization tools such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent data clearly and effectively.

By integrating these methods, the analysis yielded actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance, supporting strategic recommendations for future growth.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
```
The overall for the sales data is that 'Hat' are the highest volume product, indicating strong customer demand and popularity. The frequent purchases suggest that hats appeal to a broad consumer base, potentially benefiting from seasonal trends or being priced at an accessible level for a larger audience. Therefore since hats are selling in high quantities, it is important to ensure that inventory levels remain consistently stocked to meet demand, especially during peak sales periods.

Given the popularity of hats, targeted promotions or bundling with other products such as 'Jacket can increase overall sales. For example, discounts on 'Hat' when purchased with 'Jacket or 'Socks' which turns to be low in sales might increase cross-product sales.

- While Hat have the highest sales volume, Shoes generate the highest revenue. This likely reflects a higher price point for shoes compared to hats, as well as the potential for shoes to appeal to a more specific customer segment.

- Since shoes bring in the highest revenue, there may be an opportunity to introduce higher-end or premium models that could further increase revenue without dramatically affecting sales volume. Ensure that the supply chain for shoes is optimized to meet demand without overstocking. This can be achieved by analyzing historical sales data to forecast trends and adjust production or orders accordingly.
