# PROJECT

## PROJECT TITLE

LITA Capstone Project

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Utilizing Excel, SQL, and Power BI, this data analysis project integrates sales and customer data to uncover key insights, including sales trends, top-performing products, customer segments, and lifetime value, enabling informed business decisions through interactive visualizations and actionable recommendations. This project focuses on analyzing sales and customer data to extract meaningful insights that support strategic business decision-making. By examining key metrics, such as customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and regional sales performance, the analysis aims to understand factors driving revenue growth and customer satisfaction. This project involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to present a comprehensive view of the business landscape.

### DATA SOURCES

This project utilized two distinct datasets: 
- Sales Data
- Customer Data

Sales Data: This dataset provides detailed records of individual sales transactions, including fields such as transaction date, product information, sales amount, quantity sold, and regional data. By analyzing this dataset, we can identify trends in product performance, regional sales variations, and overall sales growth over time.

Customer Data:  This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The dataset contains information about customers, it provides basic customer identifiers, customer behavior,subscription types, purchase frequencies, and transactional history, enabling an analysis of customer purchasing patterns and frequency.

#### DATA PREPARATION

To ensure the quality and consistency of the analysis, the Sales Data and Customer Data underwent a thorough data preparation process, with each dataset processed individually due to their lack of direct relationship.

1. Data Cleaning: Both datasets contained inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicates, and varied formats in date and currency fields. Using Excel and SQL, we addressed these issues by:

- Removing duplicate entries to prevent skewed results.
  
- Standardizing date formats to ensure accurate chronological analysis.
  
- Handling missing values through deletion or imputation, depending on the significance of the data field.
  

2. Data Transformation:

- In Sales Data, columns were restructured for clarity, and additional calculated fields were created. For instance, a “Total Revenue” field was generated by multiplying quantity sold by sales price.
- In Customer Data, which comprises customer ID, customer name, region, subscription type, subscription start, subscription end, and revenue, we performed several transformations:
-- Calculated the subscription duration by determining the difference between the subscription start and end dates.
-- Analyzed revenue contributions from each subscription type to identify high-value segments.
-- Grouped customers by region to facilitate geographic analysis of subscription performance.
  
3. Data Validation:
- After cleaning and transforming the data, a final validation step was performed to ensure data consistency and accuracy. This involved cross-checking row counts, validating ranges of calculated metrics, and ensuring uniformity in data formatting.

The prepared datasets provided a reliable foundation for analysis, enabling meaningful insights into sales trends and customer behavior within the subscription model.

### ANALYSIS APPROACH

The analysis approach for this project involved a systematic examination of both the Sales Data and Customer Data using Excel, SQL and Power BI to derive insights and drive decision-making.

1. Microsoft Excel Analysis:

- After extracting relevant data subsets, Excel was utilized for deeper exploratory data analysis. Key activities included:

- Pivot Tables: Constructing pivot tables to summarize sales performance by different dimensions such as total sales by product, region, and month.

METHODOLOGY:
````
- Excel formulas were utilized to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region for sales data while calculations on the average subscription duration and identifying the most popular subscription types for the customer data. 

- To analyze sales performance by region and product, I leveraged Excel functions to efficiently calculate key metrics such as total revenue by region and average sales per product for the sales data:

i. Total Revenue by Region: SUMIF function was used. This allows a quick calculated total revenue generated in each region by summing up sales values based on region-specific criteria.
Formula Example: =SUMIF(RegionRange, "RegionName", RevenueRange) where RegionRange refers to the list of regions and RevenueRange to the sales revenue values.

![salesdata table 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f28935b6-e4cc-4450-b111-dc10c4f59127)

- Insight Gained: This approach provided a clear view of which regions contributed the most to overall sales, helping to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.
Average Sales per Product:

ii. To measure the average sales value for each product, AVERAGEIF function was used. This helped in calculating the average sales by product, giving a better understanding of product-level performance.
Formula Example: =AVERAGEIF(ProductRange, "ProductName", RevenueRange).  where ProductRange consists of product names and RevenueRange includes Revenue.

- Insight Gained: Using AVERAGEIF allows identification of products with high average sales values, highlighting potential bestsellers and helping in making data-driven decisions for inventory and pricing strategies.

In customer data, to determine the most popular subscription type, COUNTIF function in Excel was employed, which efficiently counted the occurrence of each subscription type across the dataset. This approach helped in identifying the subscription option that was most frequently selected by customers.

- Calculating Popular Subscription Type:
Using the COUNTIF function, calculation of the frequency of each subscription type within the dataset was done. This allows the determination of which subscription option had the highest count, indicating its popularity among customers.
Formula Example: =COUNTIF(SubscriptionRange, "SubscriptionType"), where SubscriptionRange includes all subscription types.

- Insight Gained: The results provided a clear view of customer preferences for subscription types. Identifying the most popular subscription option offered valuable insights into customer engagement, helping to shape strategies for marketing and customer retention.



2. SQL Analysis:

SQL was used to extract and manipulate data from the Sales Data. Key queries were written to perform aggregations and calculations, such as:

- Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount:

````````SQL
select top 5 Customer_Id as Top_Customers , SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) as Total_Purchase from [dbo].[SalesData]
group by Customer_Id
``````


![TOP 5 CUSTOMERS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e165b7f6-77bd-4e01-87f4-b7089705af40)

- Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region:
  
```````SQL
select region, CAST((SUM(quantity)*100/(select SUM(quantity) from [dbo].[SalesData])) as varchar (10)) +'%'
AS Total_sales_Percentage from [dbo].[SalesData]
group by Region
order by Total_sales_Percentage desc
``````

CUSTOMER DATA
SQL was used to extract and manipulate data from the Customer Data. Key queries were written to perform aggregations and calculations, such as:

Calculate total revenue by subscription type

``````SQL
select SUM(revenue) as Sub_Type_Revenue from [dbo].[CustomerData] 
where SubscriptionType = 'basic'

select SUM(revenue) as Sub_Type_Revenue from [dbo].[CustomerData] 
where SubscriptionType = 'premium'

select SUM(revenue) as Sub_Type_Revenue from [dbo].[CustomerData] 
where SubscriptionType = 'standard'
``````

3. Power BI Visualization:

The final stage of analysis involved creating interactive dashboards in Power BI, which enhanced the presentation of insights through advanced visualization techniques. This included:

Dynamic Dashboards: Developing comprehensive dashboards that presented key metrics such as total revenue, average subscription length, and customer distribution across regions, allowing stakeholders to gain a quick overview of business performance.

Interactive Reports: Creating interactive reports where users could drill down into specific metrics, filter data by subscription type or region, and explore trends in sales overview, top-performing products, regional breakdowns key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends and This interactivity enabled a more nuanced understanding of the data.
 
Visualizations: Utilizing a variety of visualization tools such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent data clearly and effectively.

By integrating these methods, the analysis yielded actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance, supporting strategic recommendations for future growth.
